**supybot-github** is a plugin for the python-based IRC bot Supybot (and its forks [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) and Gribble).

Its purpose is to announce commits and other important notifications from
a Github repository on an IRC channel, using Github's post commit hooks.

Please note that I am a complete beginner as far as Python and supybot plugins
are concerned, which means that you should expect bad-looking code which does
not meet any standards. I would be happy to accept any pull request to fix
my bad python coding style.
